# ✈️ Fighter Jet Simulation – Machine Learning Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end **machine learning pipeline built on custom simulation data** generated from a fighter jet model designed and simulated in SolidWorks.

Unlike typical ML projects that rely on public or pre-curated datasets, this work is based on **engineering-grade simulation data**, making the analysis closer to real-world industrial workflows.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze fighter jet simulation data
- Understand relationships between design parameters and performance outputs
- Train and compare multiple machine learning models
- Evaluate models using standard error metrics

This project bridges **core mechanical/aerospace engineering** with **applied data science and machine learning**.
